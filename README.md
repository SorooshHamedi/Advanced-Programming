C++ Object Oriented Programming and Top Down Design

Project 3: Introduction to Top Down Design by designing a program which first reads the weekly schedules of movie screenings of a town from a csv file.
  Then it manages queries by user, of which there are two type:
    1-A command to list all the movies available to watch in the town.
    2-A command which requests the screenings of a specific movie in an HTML. The program has to create a a chart with one axis being the days of the week and the other the hours of the start of screening
      In each cell should be a name of a theather. The priority is given to the one with the cheapest tickets; if there are multiple places with the same lowest price, the one with the lexicographically 
      smallest name is shown.
